This is the website for commonhardware.com.

This is a Node.js/Express application; currently it's just hosting static assets, but I've left it as a whole application just in case we want to get fancy.

To get started, install Node.js, clone this repo, and then in the `commonhardware` directory:

`npm install`

Once that's done, start the application with:

`npm start`

You'll now be able to see the site at http://localhost:3000
