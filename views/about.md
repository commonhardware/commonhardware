_Hardware is hard._ It’s an overused adage, but it’s true: creating hardware products is challenging, especially for those who have previously worked in software.

In modern software development, engineers have access to _abstraction layers_ that provide high-level APIs for interacting with low-level functionality. Abstraction means that software engineers can spend less time on plumbing and more time on the things that differentiate their product.

In hardware, there are few abstraction layers. Hardware creators typically have to optimize every detail of their product, regardless if it is a differentiator, because that’s what’s necessary to make a thing. Every screw must be carefully selected for its physical characteristics, and every surface and shape must be designed thoughtfully.

But why? Why must each of us reinvent the wheel every time we make anything new? Why is there such a lack of shared knowledge?

Open Source Hardware (OSHW) is pretty new. The first “Open Hardware Summit” took place in 2010, five years before this writing. Only recently did companies like Arduino, Chumby, littleBits, Bug Labs, and others begin releasing the design files for their hardware products.

And while the growth in OSHW is invigorating, the youth of the movement means that most open source hardware products were designed in a vacuum. While OSHW contributors (companies or individuals) are becoming more frequent, they are not yet collaborating with one another on common designs and libraries. So unless you’re building an Arduino Shield or a Raspberry Pi Hat, you’re probably still designing your hardware (open or not) from scratch.

What we need now is a set of common design principles, footprints, libraries and other resources that will give hardware creators the _abstraction layers_ that software engineers have had for decades. These “common” resources should be:
- Open source but also business-friendly, so they can be used in both open source and commercial projects
- Designed for easy prototyping, but also for an easy transition to production and mass-manufacturing
- Built upon pre-existing standards and specs where available, so long as they represent a good starting point for “common” projects

Our hope is that these “common hardware” resources will give you a good starting point for your hardware projects and encourage best practices. We expect that you will diverge from these designs, but hopefully by decreasing the variability in hardware creators’ starting points, we can provide more opportunities for documenting and sharing knowledge and best practices instead of relying on the one-on-one “craftsman/apprentice” mentorship that dominates the industry today.

We hope you find these resources useful.

#### Project status

This project is brand spankin' new. We haven't actually built anything yet. Patience, young padawan.
